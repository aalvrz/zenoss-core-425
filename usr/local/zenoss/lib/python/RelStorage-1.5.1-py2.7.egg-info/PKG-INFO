Description: 
        RelStorage is a storage implementation for ZODB that stores pickles in
        a relational database. PostgreSQL 8.1 and above (via psycopg2), MySQL
        5.0.32+ / 5.1.34+ (via MySQLdb 1.2.2 and above), and Oracle 10g and 11g
        (via cx_Oracle) are currently supported. RelStorage replaced the
        PGStorage project.

        Features
        ========
        
        * It is a drop-in replacement for FileStorage and ZEO.
        * There is a simple way to convert FileStorage to RelStorage and back again.
          You can also convert a RelStorage instance to a different relational database.
        * Designed for high volume sites: multiple ZODB instances can share the same
          database. This is similar to ZEO, but RelStorage does not require ZEO.
        * According to some tests, RelStorage handles high concurrency better than
          the standard combination of ZEO and FileStorage.
        * Whereas FileStorage takes longer to start as the database grows due to an
          in-memory index of all objects, RelStorage starts quickly regardless of
          database size.
        * Supports undo, packing, and filesystem-based ZODB blobs.
        * Both history-preserving and history-free storage are available.
        * Capable of failover to replicated SQL databases.
        * Free, open source (ZPL 2.1)
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install RelStorage using easy_install::
        
            easy_install RelStorage
        
        RelStorage requires a version of ZODB that is aware of MVCC storages.
        ZODB 3.9 supports RelStorage without any patches. ZODB 3.7 and 3.8 can
        support RelStorage if you first apply a patch to ZODB. You can get
        versions of ZODB with the patch already applied here:
        
            http://packages.willowrise.org
        
        The patches are also included in the source distribution of RelStorage.
        
        You need the Python database adapter that corresponds with your database.
        Install psycopg2, MySQLdb 1.2.2+, or cx_Oracle 4.3+.
        
        Configuring Your Database
        -------------------------
        
        You need to configure a database and user account for RelStorage.
        RelStorage will populate the database with its schema the first time it
        connects.
        
        PostgreSQL
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you installed PostgreSQL from a binary package, you probably have a
        user account named ``postgres``. Since PostgreSQL respects the name of
        the logged-in user by default, switch to the ``postgres`` account to
        create the RelStorage user and database. Even ``root`` does not have
        the PostgreSQL privileges that the ``postgres`` account has. For
        example::
        
            $ sudo su - postgres
            $ createuser --pwprompt zodbuser
            $ createdb -O zodbuser zodb
        
        New PostgreSQL accounts often require modifications to ``pg_hba.conf``,
        which contains host-based access control rules. The location of
        ``pg_hba.conf`` varies, but ``/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf`` is
        common. PostgreSQL processes the rules in order, so add new rules
        before the default rules rather than after. Here is a sample rule that
        allows only local connections by ``zodbuser`` to the ``zodb``
        database::
        
            local  zodb  zodbuser  md5
        
        PostgreSQL re-reads ``pg_hba.conf`` when you ask it to reload its
        configuration file::
        
            /etc/init.d/postgresql reload
        
        MySQL
        ~~~~~
        
        Use the ``mysql`` utility to create the database and user account. Note
        that the ``-p`` option is usually required. You must use the ``-p``
        option if the account you are accessing requires a password, but you
        should not use the ``-p`` option if the account you are accessing does
        not require a password. If you do not provide the ``-p`` option, yet
        the account requires a password, the ``mysql`` utility will not prompt
        for a password and will fail to authenticate.
        
        Most users can start the ``mysql`` utility with the following shell
        command, using any login account::
        
            $ mysql -u root -p
        
        Here are some sample SQL statements for creating the user and database::
        
            CREATE USER 'zodbuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
            CREATE DATABASE zodb;
            GRANT ALL ON zodb.* TO 'zodbuser'@'localhost';
            FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        
        Oracle
        ~~~~~~
        
        Initial setup will require ``SYS`` privileges. Using Oracle 10g XE, you
        can start a ``SYS`` session with the following shell commands::
        
            $ su - oracle
            $ sqlplus / as sysdba
        
        You need to create a database user and grant execute privileges on
        the DBMS_LOCK package to that user.
        Here are some sample SQL statements for creating the database user
        and granting the required permissions::
        
            CREATE USER zodb IDENTIFIED BY mypassword;
            GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, CREATE TABLE, CREATE SEQUENCE TO zodb;
            GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOCK TO zodb;
        
        Configuring Plone
        -----------------
        
        To install RelStorage in Plone, see the instructions in the following
        article:
        
            http://shane.willowrise.com/archives/how-to-install-plone-with-relstorage-and-mysql/
        
        Plone uses the ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` Buildout recipe to
        generate zope.conf, so the easiest way to configure RelStorage in a
        Plone site is to set the ``rel-storage`` parameter in ``buildout.cfg``.
        The ``rel-storage`` parameter contains options separated by newlines,
        with these values:
        
            * ``type``: any database type supported (``postgresql``, ``mysql``,
              or ``oracle``)
            * RelStorage options like ``cache-servers`` and ``poll-interval``
            * Adapter-specific options
        
        An example::
        
            rel-storage =
                type mysql
                db plone
                user plone
                passwd PASSWORD
        
        Configuring Zope 2
        ------------------
        
        To integrate RelStorage in Zope 2, specify a RelStorage backend in
        ``etc/zope.conf``. Remove the main mount point and add one of the
        following blocks. For PostgreSQL::
        
            %import relstorage
            <zodb_db main>
              mount-point /
              <relstorage>
                <postgresql>
                  # The dsn is optional, as are each of the parameters in the dsn.
                  dsn dbname='zodb' user='username' host='localhost' password='pass'
                </postgresql>
              </relstorage>
            </zodb_db>
        
        For MySQL::
        
            %import relstorage
            <zodb_db main>
              mount-point /
              <relstorage>
                <mysql>
                  # Most of the options provided by MySQLdb are available.
                  # See component.xml.
                  db zodb
                </mysql>
              </relstorage>
            </zodb_db>
        
        For Oracle (10g XE in this example)::
        
            %import relstorage
            <zodb_db main>
              mount-point /
              <relstorage>
                <oracle>
                  user username
                  password pass
                  dsn XE
                </oracle>
             </relstorage>
            </zodb_db>
        
        To add ZODB blob support, provide a blob-dir option that specifies
        where to store the blobs.  For example::
        
            %import relstorage
            <zodb_db main>
              mount-point /
              <relstorage>
                blob-dir ./blobs
                <postgresql>
                  dsn dbname='zodb' user='username' host='localhost' password='pass'
                </postgresql>
              </relstorage>
            </zodb_db>
        
        Configuring ``repoze.zodbconn``
        -------------------------------
        
        To use RelStorage with ``repoze.zodbconn``, a package that makes ZODB
        available to WSGI applications, create a configuration file with
        contents similar to the following::
        
            %import relstorage
            <zodb main>
              <relstorage>
                <mysql>
                  db zodb
                </mysql>
              </relstorage>
              cache-size 100000
            </zodb>
        
        ``repoze.zodbconn`` expects a ZODB URI.  Use a URI of the form
        ``zconfig://path/to/configuration#main``.
        
        
        Included Utilities
        ==================
        
        ``zodbconvert``
        ---------------
        
        RelStorage comes with a script named ``zodbconvert`` that converts
        databases between formats. Use it to convert a FileStorage instance to
        RelStorage and back, or to convert between different kinds of
        RelStorage instances, or to convert other kinds of storages that
        support the storage iterator protocol.
        
        When converting between two history-preserving databases (note that
        FileStorage uses a history-preserving format), ``zodbconvert``
        preserves all objects and transactions, meaning you can still use the
        ZODB undo feature after the conversion, and you can convert back using
        the same process in reverse. When converting from a history-free
        database to either a history-free database or a history-preserving
        database, ``zodbconvert`` retains all data, but the converted
        transactions will not be undoable. When converting from a
        history-preserving storage to a history-free storage, ``zodbconvert``
        drops all historical information during the conversion.
        
        How to use ``zodbconvert``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Create a ZConfig style configuration file that specifies two storages,
        one named "source", the other "destination". The configuration file
        format is very much like zope.conf. Then run ``zodbconvert``, providing
        the name of the configuration file as a parameter.
        
        The utility does not modify the source storage. Before copying the
        data, the utility verifies the destination storage is completely empty.
        If the destination storage is not empty, the utility aborts without
        making any changes to the destination. (Adding transactions to an
        existing database is complex and out of scope for ``zodbconvert``.)
        
        Here is a sample ``zodbconvert`` configuration file::
        
          <filestorage source>
            path /zope/var/Data.fs
          </filestorage>
        
          <relstorage destination>
            <mysql>
              db zodb
            </mysql>
          </relstorage>
        
        This configuration file specifies that the utility should copy all of
        the transactions from Data.fs to a MySQL database called "zodb". If you
        want to reverse the conversion, exchange the names "source" and
        "destination". All storage types and storage options available in
        zope.conf are also available in this configuration file.
        
        Options for ``zodbconvert``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
          ``--clear``
            Clears all data from the destination storage before copying. Use
            this only if you are certain the destination has no useful data.
            Currently only works when the destination is a RelStorage instance.
        
          ``--dry-run``
            Opens both storages and analyzes what would be copied, but does not
            actually copy.
        
        
        ``zodbpack``
        ------------
        
        RelStorage also comes with a script named ``zodbpack`` that packs any
        ZODB storage that allows concurrent connections (including RelStorage
        and ZEO, but not including FileStorage). Use ``zodbpack`` in ``cron``
        scripts. Pass the script the name of a configuration file that lists
        the storages to pack, in ZConfig format. An example configuration file::
        
          <relstorage>
            pack-gc true
            <mysql>
              db zodb
            </mysql>
          </relstorage>
        
        Options for ``zodbpack``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
          ``--days`` or ``-d``
            Specifies how many days of historical data to keep. Defaults to 0,
            meaning no history is kept. This is meaningful even for
            history-free storages, since unreferenced objects are not removed
            from the database until the specified number of days have passed.
        
          ``--prepack``
            Instructs the storage to only run the pre-pack phase of the pack but not
            actually delete anything.  This is equivalent to specifying
            ``pack-prepack-only true`` in the storage options.
        
          ``--use-prepack-state``
            Instructs the storage to only run the deletion (packing) phase, skipping
            the pre-pack analysis phase. This is equivalento to specifying
            ``pack-skip-prepack true`` in the storage options.
        
        
        Migrating to a new version of RelStorage
        ========================================
        
        Sometimes RelStorage needs a schema modification along with a software
        upgrade.  Hopefully, this will not often be necessary.
        
        Migration to RelStorage version 1.5 requires a schema upgrade.
        See `migrate-to-1.5.txt`_.
        
        .. _`migrate-to-1.5.txt`: http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/relstorage/trunk/notes/migrate-to-1.5.txt
        
        Migration to RelStorage version 1.4.2 requires a schema upgrade if
        you are using a history-free database (meaning keep-history is false).
        See `migrate-to-1.4.txt`_.
        
        .. _`migrate-to-1.4.txt`: http://svn.zope.org/*checkout*/relstorage/trunk/notes/migrate-to-1.4.txt
        
        See the `notes subdirectory`_ if you are upgrading from an older version.
        
        .. _`notes subdirectory`: http://svn.zope.org/relstorage/trunk/notes/
        
        
        RelStorage Options
        ==================
        
        Specify these options in zope.conf, as parameters for the
        ``relstorage.storage.RelStorage`` constructor, or as attributes of a
        ``relstorage.options.Options`` instance. In the latter two cases, use
        underscores instead of dashes in the option names.
        
        ``name``
                The name of the storage. Defaults to a descriptive name that
                includes the adapter connection parameters, except the database
                password.
        
        ``read-only``
                If true, only reads may be executed against the storage.
        
        ``blob-dir``
                If supplied, the storage will provide ZODB blob support; this
                option specifies the name of the directory to hold blob data.
                The directory will be created if it does not exist. If no value
                (or an empty value) is provided, then no blob support will be
                provided.
        
        ``shared-blob-dir``
                If true (the default), the blob directory is assumed to be
                shared among all clients using NFS or similar; blob data will
                be stored only on the filesystem and not in the database. If
                false, blob data is stored in the relational database and the
                blob directory holds a cache of blobs. When this option is
                false, the blob directory should not be shared among clients.
        
                This option must be true when using ZODB 3.8, because ZODB 3.8
                is not compatible with the file layout required for a blob
                cache.  Use ZODB 3.9 or later if you want to store blobs in
                the relational database.
        
        ``blob-cache-size``
                Maximum size of the blob cache, in bytes. If empty (the
                default), the cache size isn't checked and the blob directory
                will grow without bounds. This should be either empty or
                significantly larger than the largest blob you store. At least
                1 gigabyte is recommended for typical databases. More is
                recommended if you store large files such as videos, CD/DVD
                images, or virtual machine images.
        
                This option allows suffixes such as "mb" or "gb".
                This option is ignored if shared-blob-dir is true.
        
        ``blob-cache-size-check``
                Blob cache check size as percent of blob-cache-size: "10" means
                "10%". The blob cache size will be checked when this many bytes
                have been loaded into the cache. Defaults to 10% of the blob
                cache size.
        
                This option is ignored if shared-blob-dir is true.
        
        ``blob-chunk-size``
                When ZODB blobs are stored in MySQL, RelStorage breaks them into
                chunks to minimize the impact on RAM.  This option specifies the chunk
                size for new blobs. On PostgreSQL and Oracle, this value is used as
                the memory buffer size for blob upload and download operations. The
                default is 1048576 (1 mebibyte).
        
                This option allows suffixes such as "mb" or "gb".
                This option is ignored if shared-blob-dir is true.
        
        ``keep-history``
                If this option is set to true (the default), the adapter
                will create and use a history-preserving database schema
                (like FileStorage). A history-preserving schema supports
                ZODB-level undo, but also grows more quickly and requires extensive
                packing on a regular basis.
        
                If this option is set to false, the adapter will create and
                use a history-free database schema. Undo will not be supported,
                but the database will not grow as quickly. The database will
                still require regular garbage collection (which is accessible
                through the database pack mechanism.)
        
                This option must not change once the database schema has
                been installed, because the schemas for history-preserving and
                history-free storage are different. If you want to convert
                between a history-preserving and a history-free database, use
                the ``zodbconvert`` utility to copy to a new database.
        
        ``replica-conf``
                If this option is provided, it specifies a text file that
                contains a list of database replicas the adapter can choose
                from. For MySQL and PostgreSQL, put in the replica file a list
                of ``host:port`` or ``host`` values, one per line. For Oracle,
                put in a list of DSN values. Blank lines and lines starting
                with ``#`` are ignored.
        
                The adapter prefers the first replica specified in the file. If
                the first is not available, the adapter automatically tries the
                rest of the replicas, in order. If the file changes, the
                adapter will drop existing SQL database connections and make
                new connections when ZODB starts a new transaction.
        
        ``replica-timeout``
                If this option has a nonzero value, when the adapter selects
                a replica other than the primary replica, the adapter will
                try to revert to the primary replica after the specified
                timeout (in seconds).  The default is 600, meaning 10 minutes.
        
        ``poll-interval``
                Defer polling the database for the specified maximum time interval,
                in seconds.  Set to 0 (the default) to always poll.  Fractional
                seconds are allowed.  Use this to lighten the database load on
                servers with high read volume and low write volume.
        
                The poll-interval option works best in conjunction with
                the cache-servers option.  If both are enabled, RelStorage will
                poll a single cache key for changes on every request.
                The database will not be polled unless the cache indicates
                there have been changes, or the timeout specified by poll-interval
                has expired.  This configuration keeps clients fully up to date,
                while removing much of the polling burden from the database.
                A good cluster configuration is to use memcache servers
                and a high poll-interval (say, 60 seconds).
        
                This option can be used without the cache-servers option,
                but a large poll-interval without cache-servers increases the
                probability of basing transactions on stale data, which does not
                affect database consistency, but does increase the probability
                of conflict errors, leading to low performance.
        
        ``pack-gc``
                If pack-gc is false, pack operations do not perform
                garbage collection.  Garbage collection is enabled by default.
        
                If garbage collection is disabled, pack operations keep at least one
                revision of every object.  With garbage collection disabled, the
                pack code does not need to follow object references, making
                packing conceivably much faster.  However, some of that benefit
                may be lost due to an ever increasing number of unused objects.
        
                Disabling garbage collection is also a hack that ensures
                inter-database references never break.
        
        ``pack-prepack-only``
                If pack-prepack-only is true, pack operations perform a full analysis
                of what to pack, but no data is actually removed.  After a pre-pack,
                the pack_object, pack_state, and pack_state_tid tables are filled
                with the list of object states and objects that would have been
                removed.  If pack-gc is true, the object_ref table will also be fully 
                populated. The object_ref table can be queried to discover references
                between stored objects.
        
        ``pack-skip-prepack``
                If pack-skip-prepack is true, the pre-pack phase is skipped and it
                is assumed the pack_object, pack_state and pack_state_tid tables have
                been filled already. Thus packing will only affect records already
                targeted for packing by a previous pre-pack analysis run.
        
                Use this option together with pack-prepack-only to split packing into
                distinct phases, where each phase can be run during different
                timeslots, or where a pre-pack analysis is run on a copy of the
                database to alleviate a production database load.
        
        ``pack-batch-timeout``
                Packing occurs in batches of transactions; this specifies the
                timeout in seconds for each batch.  Note that some database
                configurations have unpredictable I/O performance
                and might stall much longer than the timeout.
                The default timeout is 1.0 seconds.
        
        ``pack-commit-busy-delay``
                Before each pack batch, the commit lock is requested. If the lock is
                already held by for a regular commit, packing is paused for a short
                while. This option specifies how long the pack process should be
                paused before attempting to get the commit lock again.
                The default delay is 5.0 seconds.
        
        ``cache-servers``
                Specifies a list of memcached servers. Using memcached with
                RelStorage improves the speed of frequent object accesses while
                slightly reducing the speed of other operations.
        
                Provide a list of host:port pairs, separated by whitespace.
                "127.0.0.1:11211" is a common setting.  Some memcached modules,
                such as pylibmc, allow you to specify a path to a Unix socket
                instead of a host:port pair.
        
                The default is to disable memcached integration.
        
        ``cache-module-name``
                Specifies which Python memcache module to use. The default is
                "relstorage.pylibmc_wrapper", which requires pylibmc. An
                alternative module is "memcache", a pure Python module. If you
                use the memcache module, use at least version 1.47. This
                option has no effect unless cache-servers is set.
        
        ``cache-prefix``
                The prefix for all keys in the cache.  All clients using a
                database should use the same cache-prefix.  Use this if you use
                a single cache for multiple databases.
        
        ``cache-local-mb``
                RelStorage caches pickled objects in memory, similar to a ZEO
                cache. This cache is shared between threads. This option
                configures the approximate maximum amount of memory the cache
                should consume, in megabytes.  It defaults to 10.  Set to
                0 to disable the in-memory cache.
        
        ``cache-delta-size-limit``
                This is an advanced option. RelStorage uses a system of
                checkpoints to improve the cache hit rate. This option
                configures how many objects should be stored before creating a
                new checkpoint. The default is 10000.
        
        ``commit-lock-timeout``
                During commit, RelStorage acquires a database-wide lock. This
                option specifies how long to wait for the lock before
                failing the attempt to commit. The default is 30 seconds.
        
                The MySQL and Oracle adapters support this option. The
                PostgreSQL adapter currently does not.
        
        ``commit-lock-id``
                During commit, RelStorage acquires a database-wide lock. This
                option specifies the lock ID. This option currently applies
                only to the Oracle adapter.
        
        ``create-schema``
                Normally, RelStorage will create or update the database schema on
                start-up. Set this option to false if you need to connect to a
                RelStorage database without automatic creation or updates.
        
        Adapter Options
        ===============
        
        PostgreSQL Adapter Options
        --------------------------
        
        The PostgreSQL adapter accepts:
        
        ``dsn``
            Specifies the data source name for connecting to PostgreSQL.
            A PostgreSQL DSN is a list of parameters separated with
            whitespace.  A typical DSN looks like::
        
                dbname='zodb' user='username' host='localhost' password='pass'
        
            If dsn is omitted, the adapter will connect to a local database with
            no password.  Both the user and database name will match the
            name of the owner of the current process.
        
        MySQL Adapter Options
        ---------------------
        
        The MySQL adapter accepts most parameters supported by the MySQL-python
        library, including:
        
        ``host``
            string, host to connect
        ``user``
            string, user to connect as
        ``passwd``
            string, password to use
        ``db``
            string, database to use
        ``port``
            integer, TCP/IP port to connect to
        ``unix_socket``
            string, location of unix_socket (UNIX-ish only)
        ``conv``
            mapping, maps MySQL FIELD_TYPE.* to Python functions which convert a
            string to the appropriate Python type
        ``connect_timeout``
            number of seconds to wait before the connection attempt fails.
        ``compress``
            if set, gzip compression is enabled
        ``named_pipe``
            if set, connect to server via named pipe (Windows only)
        ``init_command``
            command which is run once the connection is created
        ``read_default_file``
            see the MySQL documentation for mysql_options()
        ``read_default_group``
            see the MySQL documentation for mysql_options()
        ``client_flag``
            client flags from MySQLdb.constants.CLIENT
        ``load_infile``
            int, non-zero enables LOAD LOCAL INFILE, zero disables
        
        Oracle Adapter Options
        ----------------------
        
        The Oracle adapter accepts:
        
        ``user``
                The Oracle account name
        ``password``
                The Oracle account password
        ``dsn``
                The Oracle data source name.  The Oracle client library will
                normally expect to find the DSN in /etc/oratab.
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        You can check out from Subversion using the following command::
        
            svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/relstorage/trunk RelStorage
        
        You can also browse the code:
        
            http://svn.zope.org/relstorage/trunk/
        
        The best place to discuss development of RelStorage is on the zodb-dev
        mailing list.
        
        
        
        FAQs
        ====
        
        Q: How can I help improve RelStorage?
        
            A: The best way to help is to test and to provide database-specific
            expertise.  Ask questions about RelStorage on the zodb-dev mailing list.
        
        Q: Can I perform SQL queries on the data in the database?
        
            A: No.  Like FileStorage and DirectoryStorage, RelStorage stores the data
            as pickles, making it hard for anything but ZODB to interpret the data.  An
            earlier project called Ape attempted to store data in a truly relational
            way, but it turned out that Ape worked too much against ZODB principles and
            therefore could not be made reliable enough for production use.  RelStorage,
            on the other hand, is much closer to an ordinary ZODB storage, and is
            therefore more appropriate for production use.
        
        Q: How does RelStorage performance compare with FileStorage?
        
            A: According to benchmarks, RelStorage with PostgreSQL is often faster than
            FileStorage, especially under high concurrency.
        
        Q: Why should I choose RelStorage?
        
            A: Because RelStorage is a fairly small layer that builds on world-class
            databases.  These databases have proven reliability and scalability, along
            with numerous support options.
        
        Q: Can RelStorage replace ZRS (Zope Replication Services)?
        
            A: Yes, RelStorage inherits the asynchronous master/slave replication
            capability of MySQL and other databases.  RelStorage has also been
            proven to work with Oracle RAC.
        
        Q: How do I set up an environment to run the RelStorage tests?
        
            A: See README.txt in the relstorage/tests directory.

        Change History
        ==============
        
        1.5.1 (2011-11-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Packing: Lowered garbage collection object reference finding log level to
          debug; this stage takes mere seconds, even in large sites, but could produce
          10s of thousands of lines of log output.
        
        - RelStorage was opening a test database connection (and was leaving it
          idle in a transaction with recent ZODB versions that support
          IMVCCStorage.) RelStorage no longer opens that test connection.
        
        - zodbconvert: Avoid holding a list of all transactions in memory.
        
        - Just after installing the database schema, verify the schema was
          created correctly. This affects MySQL in particular.
        
        1.5.0 (2011-06-30)
        ------------------
        
        - PostgreSQL: Fixed another minor compatibility issue with PostgreSQL 9.0.
          Packing raised an error when the client used old an version of libpq.
        
        - Delete empty transactions in batches of 1000 rows instead of all in one
          go, to prevent holding the transaction lock for longer than absolutely
          necessary.
        
        - Oracle: Fix object reference downloading performance for large RelStorage
          databases during the garbage collection phase of a pack.
        
        - Oracle, PostgreSQL: Switch to storing ZODB blob in chunks up to 4GB
          (the maximum supported by cx_Oracle) or 2GB (PostgreSQL maximum blob size)
          to maximize blob reading and writing performance.
          
          The PostgreSQL blob_chunk schema changed to support this, see 
          notes/migrate-to-1.5.txt to update existing databases.
        
        - zodbconvert: When copying a database containing blobs, ensure the source
          blob file exists long enough to copy it.
        
        1.5.0b2 (2011-03-02)
        --------------------
        
        - Better packing based on experience with large databases.  Thanks
          to Martijn Pieters!
        
            - Added more feedback to the packing process. It'll now report
              during batch commit how much of the total work has been
              completed, but at most every .1% of the total number of
              transactions or objects to process.
        
            - Renamed the --dry-run option to --prepack and added a
              --use-prepack-state to zodbpack. With these 2 options the
              pre-pack and pack phases can be run separately, allowing re-use
              of the pre-pack analysis data or even delegating the pre-pack
              phase off to a separate server.
        
            - Replaced the packing duty cycle with a nowait locking strategy.
              The pack operation will now request the commit lock but pauses if
              it is already taken. It releases the lock after every batch
              (defaulting to 1 second processing). This makes the packing
              process faster while at the same time yielding to regular ZODB
              commits when busy.
        
            - Do not hold the commit lock during pack cleanup while deleting
              rows from the object reference tables; these tables are
              pack-specific and regular ZODB commits never touch these.
        
        - Added an option to control schema creation / updating on startup.
          Setting the ``create-schema`` option to false will let you use
          RelStorage without a schema update.
        
        - Fixed compatibility with PostgreSQL 9.0, which is capable of
          returning a new 'hex' type to the client. Some builds of psycopg2
          return garbage or raise an error when they see the new type. The fix
          was to encode more SQL query responses using base 64.
        
        - With the new shared-blob-dir option set to false, it was possible
          for a thread to read a partially downloaded blob.  Fixed.  Thanks for
          the report from Maurits van Rees.
        
        - Support for "shared-blob-dir false" now requires ZODB 3.9 or better.
          The code in the ZODB 3.8 version of ZODB.blob is not compatible with
          BlobCacheLayout, leading to blob filename collisions.
        
        1.5.0b1 (2011-02-05)
        --------------------
        
        - Added a state_size column to object_state, making it possible
          to query the size of objects without loading the state.  The new
          column is intended for gathering statistics.  A schema migration
          is required.
        
        - Added more logging during zodbconvert to show that something is
          happening and give an indication of how far along the process is.
        
        - Fixed a missing import in the blob cache cleanup code.
        
        - Added a --dry-run option to zodbpack.
        
        - Replaced the graph traversal portion of the pack code with
          a more efficient implementation using Python sets (instead of SQL).
          The new code is much faster for packing databases with deeply
          nested objects.
        
        1.5.0a1 (2010-10-21)
        --------------------
        
        - Added an option to store ZODB blobs in the database.  The option is
          called "shared-blob-dir" and it behaves very much like the ZEO
          option of the same name.  Blobs stored in the database are broken
          into chunks to reduce the impact on RAM.
        
        - Require setuptools or distribute.  Plain distutils is not sufficient.
        
        1.4.2 (2011-02-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed compatibility with ZODB 3.10.  As reported by Jürgen Herrmann,
          there was a problem with conflict errors.  The RelStorage patch of the
          sync() method now works with ZODB 3.10.
        
        - Fixed a bug in packing history-free databases.  If changes were
          made to the database during the pack, the pack code could delete
          too many objects.  Thanks to Chris Withers for writing test code
          that revealed the bug.  A schema migration is required for history-free
          databases; see notes/migration-to-1.4.txt.
        
        - Enabled logging to stderr in zodbpack.
        
        1.4.1 (2010-10-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Oracle: always connect in threaded mode.  Without threaded mode,
          clients of Oracle 11g sometimes segfault.
        
        1.4.0 (2010-09-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Made compatible with ZODB 3.10.0b7.
        
        - Enabled ketama and compression in pylibmc_wrapper.  Both options
          are better for clusters.  [Helge Tesdal]
        
        - Oracle: Use a more optimal query for POSKeyError logging.  [Helge Tesdal]
        
        - Fixed a NameError that occurred when getting the history of an
          object where transaction extended info was set.  [Helge Tesdal]
        
        1.4.0c4 (2010-09-17)
        --------------------
        
        - Worked around an Oracle RAC bug: apparently, in a RAC environment,
          the read-only transaction mode does not isolate transactions in the
          manner specified by the documentation, so Oracle users now have to
          use serializable isolation like everyone else. It's slower but more
          reliable.
        
        - Use the client time instead of the database server time as a factor
          in the transaction ID.  RelStorage was using the database server time
          to reduce the need for synchronized clocks, but in practice, that
          policy broke tests and did not really avoid the need to synchronize
          clocks.  Also, the effect of unsynchronized clocks is predictable
          and manageable: you'll get bunches of transactions with sequential
          timestamps.
        
        - If the database returns an object from the future (which should never
          happen), generate a ReadConflictError, hopefully giving the application
          a chance to recover.  The most likely causes of this are a broken
          database and threading bugs.
        
        1.4.0c3 (2010-07-31)
        --------------------
        
        - Always update the RelStorage cache when opening a database connection for
          loading, even when no ZODB Connection is using the storage.  Otherwise,
          code that used the storage interface directly could cause the cache
          to fall out of sync; the effects would be seen in the next
          ZODB.Connection.
        
        - Added a ZODB monkey patch that passes the "force" parameter to the
          sync method.  This should help the poll-interval option do its job
          better.
        
        1.4.0c2 (2010-07-28)
        --------------------
        
        - Fixed a subtle bug in the cache code that could lead to an
          AssertionError indicating a cache inconsistency.  The inconsistency
          was caused by after_poll(), which was ignoring the randomness of
          the order of the list of recent changes, leading it to sometimes
          put the wrong transfer ID in the "delta_after" dicts.  Also expanded
          the AssertionError with debugging info, since cache inconsistency
          can still be caused by database misconfiguration and mismatched
          client versions.
        
        - Oracle: updated the migration notes.  The relstorage_util package
          is not needed after all.
        
        1.4.0c1 (2010-06-19)
        --------------------
        
        - History-preserving storages now replace objects on restore instead of
          just inserting them.  This should solve problems people were
          having with the zodbconvert utility.
        
        - Oracle: call the DBMS_LOCK.REQUEST function directly instead of using
          a small package named ``relstorage_util``. The ``relstorage_util``
          package was designed as a secure way to access the DBMS_LOCK package,
          but the package turned out to be confusing to DBAs and provided no
          real security advantage.  People who have already deployed
          RelStorage 1.4.x on Oracle need to do the following:
        
              GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_LOCK TO <zodb_user>;
        
          You can also drop the ``relstorage_util`` package.  Keep the
          ``relstorage_op`` package.
        
        - Made compatible with ZODB 3.10.
        
        - MySQL: specify the transaction isolation mode for every connection,
          since the default is apparently not necessarily "read committed"
          anymore.
        
        1.4.0b3 (2010-02-02)
        --------------------
        
        - Auto-reconnect in new_oid().
        
        1.4.0b2 (2010-01-30)
        --------------------
        
        - Include all test subpackages in setup.py.
        
        - Raise an error if MySQL reverts to MyISAM rather than using the InnoDB
          storage engine.
        
        1.4.0b1 (2009-11-17)
        --------------------
        
        - Added the keep-history option. Set it to false to keep no history.
          (Packing is still required for garbage collection and blob deletion.)
        
        - Added the replica-conf and replica-timeout options.  Set replica-conf
          to a filename containing the location of database replicas.  Changes
          to the file take effect at transaction boundaries.
        
        - Expanded the option documentation in README.txt.
        
        - Revised the way RelStorage uses memcached.  Minimized the number of
          trips to both the cache server and the database.
        
        - Added an in-process pickle cache that serves a function similar to the
          ZEO cache.
        
        - Added a wrapper module for pylibmc.
        
        - Store operations now use multi-insert and multi-delete SQL
          statements to reduce the effect of network latency.
        
        - Renamed relstorage.py to storage.py to overcome import issues.
          Also moved the Options class to options.py.
        
        - Updated the patch for ZODB 3.7 and 3.8 to fix an issue with
          blobs and subtransactions.
        
        - Divided the implementation of database adapters into many small
          objects, making the adapter code more modular.  Added interfaces
          that describe the duties of each part.
        
        - Oracle: Sped up restore operations by sending short blobs inline.
        
        - Oracle: Use a timeout on commit locks.  This requires installation
          of a small PL/SQL package that can access DBMS_LOCK.  See README.txt.
        
        - Oracle: Used PL/SQL bulk insert operations to improve write
          performance.
        
        - PostgreSQL: use the documented ALTER SEQUENCE RESTART WITH
          statement instead of ALTER SEQUENCE START WITH.
        
        - Moved MD5 sum computation to the adapters so they can choose not
          to use MD5.
        
        - Changed loadSerial to load from the store connection only if the
          load connection can not provide the object requested.
        
        - Stopped wrapping database disconnect exceptions.  Now the code
          catches and handles them directly.
        
        - Use the store connection rather than the load connection for OID
          allocation.
        
        - Detect and handle backward time travel, which can happen after
          failover to an out-of-date asynchronous slave database. For
          simplicity, invalidate the whole ZODB cache when this happens.
        
        - Replaced the speed test script with a separately distributed package,
          ``zodbshootout``.
        
        - Added the ``zodbpack`` script.
        
        1.3.0b1 (2009-09-04)
        --------------------
        
        - Added support for a blob directory. No BlobStorage wrapper is needed.
          Cluster nodes will need to use a shared filesystem such as NFS or
          SMB/CIFS.
        
        - Added the blob-dir parameter to the ZConfig schema and README.txt.
        
        
        1.2.0 (2009-09-04)
        ------------------
        
        - In Oracle, trim transaction descriptions longer than 2000 bytes.
        
        - When opening the database for the first time, don't issue a warning
          about the inevitable POSKeyError on the root OID.
        
        - If RelStorage tries to unpickle a corrupt object state during packing,
          it will now report the oid and tid in the log.
        
        
        1.2.0b2 (2009-05-05)
        --------------------
        
        - RelStorage now implements IMVCCStorage, making it compatible with
          ZODB 3.9.0b1 and above.
        
        - Removed two-phase commit support from the PostgreSQL adapter. The
          feature turned out to be unnecessary.
        
        - Added MySQL 5.1.34 and above to the list of supportable databases.
        
        - Fixed minor test failures under Windows. Windows is now a supportable
          platform.
