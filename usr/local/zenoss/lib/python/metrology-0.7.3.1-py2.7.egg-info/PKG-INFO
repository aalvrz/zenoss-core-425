Description: =========
        Metrology
        =========
        
        A library to easily measure what's going on in your python.
        
        Metrology allows you to add instruments to your python code and hook them to external reporting tools like Graphite so as to better understand what's going on in your running python program.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        To install : ::
        
            pip install metrology
        
        API
        ===
        
        Gauge
        -----
        
        A gauge is an instantaneous measurement of a value
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            class JobGauge(metrology.instruments.Gauge):
                def value(self):
                    return len(queue)
            gauge = Metrology.gauge('pending-jobs', JobGauge())
        
        
        Counters
        --------
        
        A counter is like a gauge, but you can increment or decrement its value
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            counter = Metrology.counter('pending-jobs')
            counter.increment()
            counter.decrement()
            counter.count
        
        Meters
        ------
        
        A meter measures the rate of events over time (e.g., "requests per second").
        In addition to the mean rate, you can also track 1, 5 and 15 minutes moving averages
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            meter = Metrology.meter('requests')
            meter.mark()
            meter.count
        
        Timers
        ------
        
        A timer measures both the rate that a particular piece of code is called and the distribution of its duration
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            timer = Metrology.timer('responses')
            with timer:
                do_something()
        
        
        Utilization Timer
        -----------------
        
        A specialized timer that calculates the percentage of wall-clock time that was spent
            
        .. code-block:: python
        
            utimer = Metrology.utilization_timer('responses')
            with utimer:
              do_something()
        
        Profilers
        ---------
        
        A profiler measures the distribution of the duration passed in a every part of the code
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            profiler = Metrology.profiler('slow-code')
            with profiler:
                run_slow_code()
        
        
        Reporters
        =========
        
        Logger Reporter
        ---------------
        
        A logging reporter that write metrics to a logger
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            reporter = LoggerReporter(level=logging.INFO, interval=10)
            reporter.start()
        
        
        Graphite Reporter
        -----------------
        
        A graphite reporter that send metrics to graphite
        
        .. code-block:: python
            
            reporter = GraphiteReporter('graphite.local', 2003)
            reporter.start()
        
        
        Librato Reporter
        ----------------
        
        A librator metric reporter that send metrics to librato API
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            reporter = LibratoReporter("<email>", "<token>")
            reporter.start()
